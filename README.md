As a fan of Pinterest, I always wondered how they designed their loading screen.It seems simple, but it also conveys a sense of anticipation and excitement.
So I decided to challenge myself and create a prototype of Pinterest's loading screen using Figma. It was a fun and rewarding project that taught me a lot about UI designing andanimation.
